# UE4 GAS Extensions

This plug-in is a collection of abilities, tasks, and other things to expand upon the Gameplay Ability System (GAS) of Unreal.

The initial work comes from the repository https://github.com/tranek/GASShooter and more features were added after (like the hitscan task)

This plugin depends upon the plugin https://github.com/TheEmidee/UE4GameBaseFramework because of some IsDataValid functions, which use macros defined in that other module.

It is planned to move those data validation macros in a separate module later.
